	<h2 ID="title">Horizon Zero Dawn</h2>
	<p>With multiplayer being such a big focus, and selling points of many modern games, I do tend to admire it when developers double down on delivering a strong well fleshed out single-player experience. This is exactly what you get with Horizon Zero Dawn. You've got a lot going on at once, and somehow it manages to just seamlessly come together as one cohesive open-world adventure. </p>
	<h2>The Story</h2>
	<p>At the beginning of the game there's a lot of mystery behind the current situation of Earth. Animalistic Machines now appear to have spread across the environment, and humanity has regress back into a  tribal state. What this results in is an interesting blend of sci-fi and nomadic themes, where you have this very advanced tech around humans that have no hope of fully understanding it. And so in this more primal civilization, the superstition is built up around the machines by those that hunt and fear them. Amongst this fascinating premise is Aloy, who serves as the main protagonist of the game. She works very well as a character you can root for. Since birth she's been an outsider, desperate to be accepted by a tribe, while being rejected as an outcast. She grows up being taught by an experienced survivalists, and by the time she comes of age she's able to participate in the “proving”.</p>

	<p>From this very personal story, the narrative then expands into something much larger than Aloy. You gradually begin to unravel the secret behind what led to the world ending up like this. The game manages to convey its narrative through cinematic cutscenes, but also the more understated character interactions that you have a rowing guiding. You can choose Aloy to react intelligently, emotionally or aggressively, in certain situations.</p>
	<h2>Gameplay</h2>
	<p>First and foremost fighting machines is fun, especially if they're big. Aloy is very skilled with a bow and arrow, which you can use to target the weak points on machines. Sometimes this might just mean removing a piece of armor, but sometimes you end up causing a satisfying chain reaction, where the machine will suddenly burst into flame or being gulfed in ice. If you're the kind of player who likes to go in prepared, you can scan machines ahead of time to see where the weak points are and what elements are best used. By elements I mean you can use fire arrows to burn over time, electricity to incapacitate and frost to well freeze.</p>

	<p>You aren't limited to just a bow and arrow. Other weapons like a tripwire, can be used to lure machines into traps. You do also have the option to go in for a melee strike, but this is best used when machine has been knocked over. One of my favorite tricks is to machine override. An early use of this is to take over a Strider that you can then use as a horse. But later on, you can do some very interesting stuff. One example is overriding a thunderjaw, and then getting it to shoot another one to pieces. When you take down machines you can loot them for modifications. These modifications can then be equipped to your armor and weapons. Thus adding an interesting RPG aspect to the game.</p>
	<h2>Graphics</h2>
	<p>Graphically the game speaks for itself. It's a great combination of technical prowess combined with artistic beauty. It's not just an engine that works for one environment type either, whether you're in a snowy mountain or a barren desert the game looks great.</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>Horizon zero dawn delivers on both quality and quantity. Aloy is a compelling protagonist, and the story is very interesting. Combat is dynamic in this game, and the graphics are astonishing.</p>
