	<p>Arms is Nintendo’s latest attempt at creating a new IP and a new multiplayer focused game on Nintendo Switch. Much like Splatoon, you’ll find some interesting single player content here, but the life of this new game is pretty much in the multiplayer, both online and locally.
	</p>
	<p>Created by the same team that worked on Mario Kart 8. Arms has you play as one of 10 character each equipped with their own set of special arms and characteristics. The characters are lovable and charming, each with their own little theme of style. You’re allowed to set three different types of arms before a match, and then mix and match before a new match. Different characters can equip different variations of arms, each with their own attributes that can contribute to a turn in the battle. For example Helix’s Blorb arms are heavy and short range, but they pack quite a punch and can leave an opponent distracted with ink on their screen when they get hit. While on the other hand SpringMan’s toaster arms move relatively quickly and get a damage boost whenever Spring Man is low on health. Each of the characters have slight differences too them. For example Master Mummy is really big, so he doesn’t flinch as much when being punched, but at a cost of moving slowly, while Byte & Bark offers a duo fighter of sorts. </p>

	<p>The combinations of the different arms and the match ups between arm-sets is where the meta game for Arms lies. Players will spend time trying out new arms they unlock and seeing which arms coordinate well together and against other types of arms. At the end of any matches you’re rewarded with credits that you can use to buy new arms for your characters. Arms are bought in a lottery sense where you use the credits to play a target mini game. In these mini games you can earn new arms, which is unlocked completely random.</p>

	<p>During a match, players will have the option to choose whether they’d like to play with motion controls or physical buttons.</p>
	<p>Playing with the joycons separately activates the motion controls, here you can thrust your arms forward to launch the corresponding arms in the game. You can also curve your punches simply by twisting your punches in real life towards a direction. Launching both of them forward activates a grab  that can break through guards, and deals quite a bit of damage. Guarding is done by pointing each joycon to each other, and movement is controlled by pointing both joycon towards a certain direction. The motion controls also have some buttons too, each of the shoulder buttons are dedicated to either a dash or a jump. While one of the triggers is dedicated to activating your rush attack. This is a special move that launches a bunch of punches at once. It’s slowly built up during a match with every punch you throw, you can actually see it build up with the little white triangle next to your health bar. With the next arms update, you will be able to remap the controls.</p>

	<p>The physical button controls map everything to a corresponding button, and for me personally I found this controller scheme to be my favorite. Often times I’d misinput or be misrecognized when playing with motion controls. Sometimes throwing two separate punches when I meant to grab or curving a punch when I didn’t mean to. The physical button controls offer a more precise input, though both options are valid and completely up to you to try out. I’m just giving you my preference. If you choose to go with button controls, you can choose between the Joycon grip, the pro controller or a single joycon. </p>
	<h2>Diffrent Modes</h2>
	<p>Arms offers about 6 different match types for you to play, but the normal fights are the main part of Arms. You can duke out against other players in the the regular fight mode, or go for a team fight if you’re playing with more than two people. There’s a total of 10 characters to play as along with 10 different maps to fight on. I’d definitely say this is the main attraction when talking about the game modes in Arms. Matches come in sets of two, and feel like you’re playing a game of mech robots fighting, only on a much smaller scale. The basic gameplay can be described as a game of cat and mouse, waiting for you opponent to mess up a punch that leaves them open for you to atack. It’s a mind game really, but a pretty fun one. While the basic gameplay is pretty simple, the real meta game lies in the arms selection, as stated earlier.</p>
	<p>V-Ball is the next game mode and it’s basically a game of volleyball, although I got to be honest it turns more into a game of spaming punches as you try to prevent the volley-ball bomb from falling on your side of the map. This game mode is my least favorite of the bunch as it feels like it doesn’t take much strategy, and the matches tend to be rather short.</p>
	<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8535975/Switch_ARMS_Direct_SCRN_4.jpg" alt="V-ball mode" class="middle">
	<p>Hoops is a game of basketball that feels like a game of fencing. You’re trying to grab your opponent in order to throw them into a hoop, just like a game of basketball. It’s another mind game of reading your opponents moves looking for the right opportunity for a grab while avoiding being grabbed yourself. You can also rush punch your enemy towards the sideline to get them to bounce off the trampoline border and into the hoop. Hoops is my personal favorite game mode outside of the main fights. </p>

	<p>Skillshot is a break the targets game where you’re trying to breake targets in a row, while at the same time as an enemy is trying to do the same. Chain your target breaks while avoiding your enemy's attacks and distractions. Games are won by having the best score, I feel like even if you dominate at regular fights, skillshot is a game where everyone has an equal shot at winning. </p>
	<img src="https://techraptor.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ARMS-Skillshot-Straight-Punch.jpg" alt="Skillshot mode" class="middle">
	<p>Lastly there’s 1-on-100 which is basically a game of survival against 100 enemies. Every 10 enemies or so, the difficulty gets ranked up with bombs falling from the sky and the enemies getting smarter and more challenging. This is a good mode to use as practice, especially if you want to rank up online.
	</p>
	<p>Arms main single player mode is the Grand Prix, a mix and of 10 fights against the roster of enemies sometimes with normal fights, and sometimes with the other game modes I mentioned earlier. You can think of this as the game’s story mode, but really it’s just as lacking as let’s say the story in the first Splatoon. It really acts like a tutorial mode of sorts and you can change the difficulty of the mode to better suit your proficiency level. Outside of Grand Prix you have Versus which lets you play the 6 different game modes I mentioned earlier with up to 4 players.</p>
	<h2>Multiplayer</h2>
	<p>Party mode creates lobbies where you can quickly jump into online matches against other random strangers. This can be played alone or with a friend in a party match. While playing the public test punch, finding a match was incredibly quick and very seamless. I didn’t have to wait long between matches and I was able to quickly change my characters if I wanted to. Arms honestly features some of the best online servers I’ve seen in a Nintendo game in terms of the quality and wait times. I never experienced lag in any of my matches online. I just wish once again, that there was some sort of communication system but once again, it’s missing from this Nintendo game too. </p>
	<img src="http://cdn.gamer-network.net/2017/usgamer/Switch_ARMS_Direct_SCRN_10.jpg" alt="Lobby system, mixes and matches randomly" class="middle">
	<p>Outside of party match, there’s a rank match that puts you up against players at your same skill level. This is your best bet at getting better at Arms, especially if you’re looking to play competitively. If you’re not into playing competitively, you also have the friends option to join matches against your friends online. Similar to Smash Brothers for Wii u, you can create a lobby here or join lobbies that your friends have made.</p>
	<p>The last option is the local wireless multiplayer mode, here you can play with friends around you that have a second Switch over a wireless internet connection, the lan mode if you will. </p>
	<h2>Music and Visuals</h2>
	<p>Moving on to visuals and music, Arms has one of the best sounding theme songs I’ve ever heard. It’s absurdly catchy, I can’t but hum along to the music every time it plays in the game. The rest of the music is pretty good, and often act as variations of the main theme. Here have a listen:</p>
	<audio controls class="middle">

  	<source src="ARMS Soundtrack - Main Theme  GrandPrix.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
	Your browser does not support the audio element.
	</audio> 
	<p>Visually Arms is one of the better looking games on the Nintendo Switch. It runs at 1080p 60 frames per second when in tv mode, and that gets dropped when you jump into matches with more than one player locally. When two players are playing on one Switch it’s dropped to 900p 60fps, and 900p 30fps when 4 players are playing on one switch. In portable mode the game runs at 720p 60fps, and it’s a really solid experience when commuting on the go, and getting in those grand prix matches, especially since I tend to play with the physical buttons. </p>
	<p>Arms has a lot of similarities with Splatoon for me. It’s without a doubt a multiplayer centric game with a suggested focus toward online multiplayer. This is Nintendo’s best work in terms of online play in recent memory. Games are quick to jump into and the lobby system for party mode is incredible. All the online multiplayer game modes are available in single player mode too but aren’t as fun when playing alone, I’d say they feel like just practice for the actual online play. While the gameplay can feel bland at first glance, the research and strategy of picking the best arms and finding your sweet spot combination is fun. The one drawback outside of the bare minimum single player content is really what I feel is a lack of content. Though the online multiplayer is fun I feel like there’s something missing here sort of to the extent how many felt about Splatoon at launch. Arms is fun I’m just not sure how much the current game modes will sustain my attention for much longer over the next few weeks and months. Nintendo has come out and stated that they’re going to be supporting the game with free new fighters, maps and updates in the future so it could be another Splatoon strategy which in that case originally turned out great in my opinion.</p>
	<p>If you enjoyed what you played in the testpunch I think Arms is worth picking up at full price, it’s a very entertaining and adrenaline rising multiplayer game. Just know that the content can be a bit low for now but it seems like if Nintendo follows the approach they did with Splatoon, it won’t be a problem for long.</p>
